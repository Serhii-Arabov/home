            When Smashing Magazine approached Netlify, they managed a dizzying
            number of tools across different functional areas of their site
            including their magazine, content, e-commerce platform, comments
            engine, subscription service and member login.
          </p>

            <li>
              6x their site speed, from a load time of 800 ms to just 80 ms
            </li>
            <li>
              Migrate from several disparate tools to a single unified platform
            </li>
            <li>
              Build a design they loved without the limitations of WordPress
            </li>
            <li>
              Develop the most performant site possible with a focus on
              reliability and speed.
